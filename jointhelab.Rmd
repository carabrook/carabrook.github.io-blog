### **PhD Positions**

I will be starting as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Ecology and Evolution](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago in summer 2021. I am currently recruiting graduate students to [apply](https://biosciences.uchicago.edu/admissions) by December 1, 2020 to join my new lab in autumn 2021. I'm looking for motivated students with broad interests in disease ecology, conservation biology, and/or epidemiology who are eager to undertake a multi-faceted PhD involving some combination of field study, molecular work, and dynamical modeling. If interested, please don't hesitate to reach out!

### **Postdocs**

I will be recruiting **two postdocs** to join my lab in summer or fall 2021. The exact specifications of the work will be flexible, but I envision that one position will involve semi-remote management of Ekipa Fanihy (see [Team](team.html)) and analysis of 7+ years of longterm Madagascar fruit bat data, while the other position will be focused on phylodynamic inference and novel virus discovery from our new Gates-funded sequencing efforts in part with [Institut Pasteur of Madagascar ](http://www.pasteur.mg/) (see [Research](research_interests.html)). I plan to advertise these positions formally in spring 2021, but if you are interested in either or both, please drop me a line to discuss timing and fit for the job.
<br> 
<br> 
Independent postdoctoral fellows are additionally always welcome, and I am happy to advise any interested individuals on related fellowship or grant applications. I have previous experience as both a [Miller Fellow](http://miller.berkeley.edu/) and a [Branco Weiss Fellow](https://brancoweissfellowship.org/) myself and would be delighted to help strategize an application.

### **Field Technicians**

In part with Ekipa Fanihy, I periodically hire **Field Technicians** (usually American post-bac students; see [Team](team.html)) to work with Malagasy graduate students catching and collecting samples from wild fruit bats in Madagascar. I have found this to be rewarding opportunity for both parties to engage in scientific and cultural exhange. Field tech positions are currently on hold due to COVID-19; however, I am hopeful that we will be able to hire new techs sometime in early-to-mid 2021. I will advertise these positions formally as they become available. In the meantime, an outdated job description from pre-pandemic is available for your perusal [here](fieldtechjob.html). Please feel free to contact me with any questions!
