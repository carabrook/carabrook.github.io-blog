<img src="cara_pic.jpg" alt="headshot" style="height: 275px; padding-right: 10px;" align="left"> A Bay Area Native, Cara grew up in beautiful Sonoma County, CA and graduated from Stanford University with a B.S. degree in [Earth Systems](https://pangea.stanford.edu/esys) in 2010. Post-graduation, she spent two years working a variety of science and development-related jobs as: a [communications intern with World Wildlife Fund in Madagascar](http://wwf.panda.org/how_you_can_help/volunteer/volunteer/volunteer_stories/madagascar/vondrozo_forest/cara_brook/); a field coordinator for a Smithsonian Institution project focused on emerging rodent-borne diseases in Laikipia, Kenya,  a GIS analyst for [Peninsula Open Space Trust](https://openspacetrust.org/); and a research technician on the [USGS Minnesota Wolf Project](http://www.davemech.org/volunteering.html). In the fall of 2012, Cara moved to New Jersey to embark on a PhD in the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University](https://eeb.princeton.edu/) and began chasing bat viruses across Madagascar. In August 2017, she defended her dissertation and moved to Berkeley, California to complete a postdoctoral fellowship with the [Miller Institute](http://miller.berkeley.edu/about), working jointly in the labs of [Professor Mike Boots](https://bootslab.org/) and [Professor Britt Glaunsinger](http://glaunsingerlab.berkeley.edu/) in the Departments of Integrative Biology and Plant and Microbiology. After completing her Miller fellowship, she began a [Branco Weiss Society in Science Fellowship](https://brancoweissfellowship.org/), still based at UC Berkeley. In summer 2021, Cara will begin an Assistant Professorship in the [Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/) in summer 2021. When I'm not doing science, you'll find me running or hiking throughout the North American West.<br>
