<br>
In the **Brook Lab** in the [Department of Ecology and Evolution](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/) at the **University of Chicago**, we work at the interface of disease ecology and conservation biology to study the dynamics of zoonotic infections, pathogens transmitted from wildlife to human hosts. 
<br>
<br>
We combine tools from field biology, molecular immunology, and epidemiological modeling to understand how zoonotic pathogens persist, transmit, and evolve in wild reservoir and spillover human hosts. Much of our work is focused on zoonotic infections derived from bat reservoirs, and we conduct the majority of our field studies in Madagascar.
