### **Work Description**

This one-year position (start and end date are somewhat flexible) will involve co-leading monthly field expeditions for Ekipa Fanihy in collaboration with Anecia Gentles, Christian Ranaivoson, Angelo Andrianiaina, Fifi Ravelomanantsoa, and Sarah Guth (see [Team](team.html)). The new Field Project Manager will spend approximately 70% of his or her time in the field, in part with Ekipa Fanihy's monthly missions to roost sites for *Pteropus rufus,* *Eidolon dupreanum,* and *Rousettus madagascariensis* in the District of Moramanga, Madagascar. 

The team will travel up to a full day's journey for each mission in a vehicle with hired driver sponsored by [Institut Pasteur de Madagascar ](http://www.pasteur.mg/) (IPM). In the field, the team will reside in tents provided by the project for up to two weeks at a time. During field missions, a local cook will be hired to prepare meals, and all expenses (including food) will be funded by the project.

While in the field, the manager will join the rest of the field team to capture bats, collect biological samples (blood, urine, feces, saliva, ectoparasites, wing punches, tooth extractions from a subset of bats under isofluorane anesthesia), and undertake basic sample preparation (i.e. centrifugation) and sample storage in liquid nitrogen. 

In between field missions (30% of the time), the manager will live in a shared house with the other foreign team members in the Ambotrarahaba District of Madagascar's capitol city of Antananarivo (house includes a modern kitchen, ample living space, two bathrooms, two bunkbeds in two bedrooms, WiFi, on-site security, and weekly cleaning services). In Antananarivo ('Tana'), the new manager will work with his or her co-manager (Anecia Gentles) to further treat and organize samples on the laboratory campus of IPM. Together, the co-managers will be additionally responsible for restocking, packing, and preparation of field supplies for recurring field missions. Managers may be asked to participate in basic laboratory manipulations of samples (DNA/RNA extractions, PCR, etc.) at IPM after field obligations have been fulfilled.

See [Research Interests](research_interests.html) for an overview of the scientific questions underpinning the field work, and visit our [National Geographic Blogsite](https://openexplorer.nationalgeographic.com/expedition/ekipafanihy/) to track our team's progress in the field.

### **Compensation**

The project will provide the following services to the manager prior to or upon immediate arrival to Madagascar:

* international roundtrip airfare from the manager's home international airport to Madagascar and back
* reimbursement for all visa fees incurred during the project
* International SOS evacuation healthcare coverage for the duration of the manager's tenure on the project
* access to basic medical supplies, including antibiotics for traveller's diarrhea (ciproflaxin)
* all field gear (including sleeping bag, pad, and tent space) required for the work
* a $3000 advance research stipend to help offset costs of travel preparation


Once in country, the manager will receive a \$350 USD/month living stipend to cover his or her share of the apartment rental (~$100/month) and to buy food while based in the capital. This monthly stipend should be sufficient enough to live comfortably in Madagascar, and the applicant can expect that he or she will not need to rely on personal funds for normal day-to-day living costs. 

Using the advance stipend, the manager will be required and responsible for obtaining the following medical services prior to arrival to Madagascar: 

* rabies pre-vaccine (often close to $1000 if not covered by insurance)
* sufficient malaria medication (malarone, doxycycline, or mefloquine) to cover one year of travel post-start date
* US-based health insurance (we expect that many applicants will already have this sponsored through their guardian).

**A note on diversity and inclusion:** 
</div>

**We are an equal-opportunity group. Applicants from underrepresented backgrounds, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, and lifestyles are enthusiastically encouraged to apply.** We acknowledge that we are unable to provide a salary competitive with full-time US-based employment for Field Project Managers at this time. However, we are committed to ensuring that this opportunity does not fall under the "unpaid internship" designation, which has been shown to reinforce socioeconomic inequities. Therefore, if the above compensation description is inadequate for your needs, please inform us of this in your application submission. We will review applications on a case-by-case basis and do our best to making this opportunity accessible for the right applicant, independent of financial constraints.
